I noticed your question about "{user_question}" but I'm not completely sure what financial information you're looking for.

Could you please provide a bit more detail or rephrase your question? You can ask me about:

- Your income and salary information
- Your spending patterns (overall or by merchant like Amazon, Zomato, etc.)
- Your budget and expenses
- Your credit card usage and balances
- Your savings rate and investments
- Your subscriptions and recurring payments
- Your debt-to-income ratio

For example, you could ask "What's my spending on Amazon?" or "Show me my monthly expenses" or "What's my current credit card balance?"
